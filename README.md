# Spatial-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

## Semester-long graduate school class, taken at Johns Hopkins University - weekly assignment descriptions below.


Week 1 - Python Review

This week will review Python basics. The topics will cover looping, data types and other Python syntax.

Week 2 - OOP Basics

This week will be a review of developing classes and other structures.

Week 3 - Algorithm Analysis

This week students will begin to analyze code performance. Algorithm analysis is just calculating the speed/time it takes to complete some task. Some tasks take constant time and some algorithms take exponential time along with everything in between. This lesson will cover the analysis of these questions.

Week 4 - Basic Geometric Operations

This weeks lesson focuses on the essential algorithms in GIS that involve geometric operations.

Week 5 - Recursion and Array-based Sequences

This week will introduce recursion and will introduce array-based sequences.

Week 6 - Polygon Overlay

This week students will explore the common task of intersections with geometries.

Week 7 - Sorting Algorithms

This week will introduce the basics of sorting and analyze the performance of various sorting algorithms.

Week 8 - Trees

This week will introduce students to the concepts of trees and the terminology associated with this data structure.

Week 9 - Binary Search Trees

This week will introduce binary search trees and cover topics related to this data structure.

Week 10 - Introduction to Spatial Indexes

This week will introduce spatial indexing for points, lines and polygons. It will show how you can quickly find and locate spatial information.

Week 11 - k-D Trees 

This week will dive into another common tree format called k-D Tree. k-D Trees are a widely used GIS data structure that allows individuals to perform distance searches quickly.

Week 12 - QuadTrees

This week will dive into another common spatial index called a QuadTree. This data structure is used to partition spaces into smaller regions and track what is in them. This lesson will examine them in detail.

Week 13 - Graph Algorithms

This week will cover Graph Algorithms and their uses.

Week 14 - Network Analysis

This week will dive deeper into graphs and build upon the information we learned from the previous lessons.
